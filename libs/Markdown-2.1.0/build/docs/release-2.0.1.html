<p>Python-Markdown 2.0.1 is a bug-fix release. No new features have been added.
Most notably, various issues with the command line script have been fixed.
There have also been a few fixes for minor parsing bugs in some edge cases.
For a full list of changes, see the git log.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-incompatible Changes</h2>
<p>Due to various complications in how Python handles command line scripts in 
differance systems and with differant installation tools, we were forced to 
rename the commandline script to <code>markdown</code> (no ".py"). A matching batch
script will get installed on Windows. Any shell scripts which call 
<code>markdown.py</code> will need to be altered to call <code>markdown</code> instead.</p>
