Infrequently Asked Questions-

Why do you use bcrypt, rather than scrypt?
	Because there is a python implemention of bcrypt, and not one for scrypt.
	I don't trust my ability to implement scrypt securely myself, and would rather use existing implementations.
	
Why not use GPG to store data?
	RSA with PSS is ported to more architectures/platforms. 
	GPG basically all wraps through the one implementation, and is not easy to run with PyPy, Android, whatever.	

Why use 2048-bit keys, rather than 4096-bit keys?
	Pluric will work with keys of any length, but 2048 bit keys are substantially faster to generate.
	2048-bit keys really are sufficiently hard to factor.
