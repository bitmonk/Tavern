We've setup a Vagrant Image to make Developent faster and easier.

You'll only need a few pieces to make it work. 
If you've done dev work on other projects, you may already have them.

	1) Install VirtualBox, https://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	2) Install Vagrant, via http://downloads.vagrantup.com
	3) cd the Vagrant directory, and run "vagrant up"

You should be all set!
If everything went smoothly, you should be able to connect to Tavern at 

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

To administer it, cd to the Vagrant directory, and run "vagrant ssh"

---

This will download a baseimage, and apply the Tavern settings using install.sh.
If you don't trust the base image, it's easy to make your own, using Veewee.
Alternatively, install it manually using Virtualbox and an a iso, and name it tavern-minimal

To create your own image-
	1) First, install veewee:
		git clone https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee.git
	2) cd veewee
	3) rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p320
	4) rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p320
	5) gem install bundler
	6) bundle install

Now, let's create an image for Tavern
	1) veewee vbox define 'tavern-minimal' 'ubuntu-13.10-server-amd64'
	2) bundle exec veewee vbox build 'tavern-minimal'
	3) bundle exec veewee vbox export 'tavern-minimal'
	4) cp tavern-minimal.box ..
	5) cd ..
	6) 
		change the line in the Vagrantfile from
		  config.vm.box_url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnayxfshxobvrsu/tavern-minimal.box"
		to
		  config.vm.box_url = "tavern-minimal.box"
