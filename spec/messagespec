The "time_added" format is the number of seconds since the epoch, expressed in UTC.

The 'PAYLOAD_SHA512' should be the SHA-512 hash of the 'PAYLOAD' portion. This is included to give each message a unique MessageID, so it can be referenced, stored, etc.
SHA1 or 256 likely would have been sufficient, but 512 decreases collision chance. 


The stamps section allows an authority to sign the "message" portion of the message, to verify that some criteria has been satisfied. 
Exactly what criteria this is depends on the Authority- Examples might be 'completed a captcha', or 'Authenticated with a FB username/password'

We define two stamps in particular- 
    One is class Author, which is signed with the public key of the person who submitted the message.
    The second is class Server, which is signed by each server that touches the message.
    Origin is the FIRST server to touch the message.

Each stamp has a "signature" which should be an RSA signature of the 'Message' portion. The signature uses a SHA512 digest and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.


The server's signature should also be of the "Message" portion, not the entire container.

"Regarding" should be the 'POSTID_SHA512' of the message, if any, that this is in reference to.  If this is not in reference to another message, this field should be omitted.



The "topic" field may be used to specify the overall topic. This can be thought of akin to a HashTag in twitter, a Subreddit on Reddit, or a Newsgroup on Usenet.  
There may only ever be ONE topic. This topic must not be longer than 200 characters.

The optional "TO" field allows you to specify a public key of a person to whom the message is directed. Their client may or may not look for this field.
You may specify any number of "TO" fields, but many servers will not carry a message if it has too many. (Pluric.com limits you to 100)
You may omit a "TO" tag- Most messages shouldn't carry one!


The "Author" fields are included to positively tie a message with an author. This is included inside of the 'Message' block so that it is signed, along with the rest of the message.
	The 'from' field should contain the RSA public key of the author. This is used as the author's primary identity. A client might include a "Follow User" button using this.
	If you need to display a shortened version of this field for length concerns, SHA1 is customary.
	The optional 'About' field may contain a POSTID-SHA512 linking to the author's most-recent about-me Post.
	The 'friendlyname' is a friendly-short name, that is not necessarily unique across services. We don't call it a username, since that implies uniqueness.


The useragent dictionary MUST contain at least two entries- 'name' and 'version' - Version should be a number, while name may be whatever you want.
	Many/Most clients would be distributed to end-users (iPhone/Android/Etc). Even if the source were obscured the private signing key would need to be included, and could be extracted.
	Since this is impossible to secure, it's best to treat this like a web browser's USER-AGENT. Interesting to know, but Entirely untrusted.
	If you *really* want to sign a message, include a 'STAMP' signature by the server, or, if you really, really, really want to, the client.


The "Subject" should contain the subject of the message. If you are replying to an existing message, it's fine to import from that message. 
	There's no reason to modify the subject, but it won't hurt anything.
	Adding a  "RE: " is stupid. 
	Just set the "regarding" field.
	The subject field may not be longer than 200 characters.

The "Body" section should be plaintext, formatted in markdown or bbcode. 
	Specify which you are using by with the 'formatting' tag (ex: 'formatting':'markdown' ) 

Any binaries that are to be included should have a the SHA512 of their uploaded file.

The 'Message' section may alternatively be replaced by 'ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE'.

<ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE>
	<TO>PUBLICKEY_ABCDEFG</TO>
	<ENC_DATA>28eab1ff5e9f0ad6d298a2fa4b510f5454abbdb17c3a225784fce6c560e....</ENC_DATA>
</ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE>

The "To" field is optional, and allows clients to quickly discard a message if they know it is not one they can read.
The "ENC_DATA" text should be identical to the "MESSAGE" text above, including formatting, after decryption by the proper private-key.
In this case, the "POSTID-SHA512" field, should contain the SHA-512 of the "ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE" field.
