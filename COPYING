--- yENC license ---

Hi Colin,
I apologize for my bad English. Actually It's been a very long time
since I last worked on yenc module and I really don't have a
repository for the source, the only sources lying around I'm aware of
are those from the Debian repository.
Just let me know which version you're using and I will release it in
under LGPL (or consider yourself fully authorized to make all the
necessary modifications in disclaimers and comments, I know this is
not an orthodox approach)

---- 10 Gen Mongo ----


Our goal with using AGPL is to preserve the concept of copyleft with MongoDB. With traditional GPL, copyleft was associated with the concept of distribution of software. The problem is that nowadays, distribution of software is rare: things tend to run in the cloud. AGPL fixes this “loophole” in GPL by saying that if you use the software over a network, you are bound by the copyleft. Other than that, the license is virtually the same as GPL v3.

Note however that it is never required that applications using mongo be published. The copyleft applies only to the mongod and mongos database programs. This is why Mongo DB drivers are all licensed under an Apache license. Your application, even though it talks to the database, is a separate program and “work”.

Dear Colin,

thank you very much for the e-mail - I'm flattered. Of course, you may use the code. Consider it under the same MIT licence as the original.

Hi Colin,

I never expected that someone might be interested in that code! 
I grant you permission to use it in any way you prefer, no need to keep the copyright notices too. 

So, feel free to modify it and don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. 

Good luck with your project!
