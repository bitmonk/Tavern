We've setup a Vagrant Image to make Developent faster.
It's build using veewee, since the ubuntu Raring builds weren't always working right.
Vagrant 1.x is kinda old, so I've built the file assuming vagrant 1.1+
This means that you should install via http://downloads.vagrantup.com, not rubygems.


Fire it up with
	vagrant up

This will install Tavern with the settings in bootstrap.sh

If you want to build your own version of the Vagrant box, it's pretty straightforward.
First, install veewee:
	git clone https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee.git
	cd veewee
	rvm install rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p320
	rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p320
	gem install bundler
	bundle install

Now, let's create an image for Tavern
	veewee vbox define 'tavern-minimal' 'ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64'
	bundle exec veewee vbox build 'tavern-minimal'
	bundle exec veewee vbox export 'tavern-minimal'
	cp tavern-minimal.box ..
	cd ..
	change the line in the Vagrantfile from
		  config.vm.box_url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnayxfshxobvrsu/tavern-minimal.box"
	to
		  config.vm.box_url = "tavern-minimal.box"
