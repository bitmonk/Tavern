Pluric is a Decentralized, Anonymous, Peer to Peer forum, written in Tornado and Python3.
It is designed to be censorship resistant, and is based on the idea of passing signed messages.

There is a Specification for messages in the "Spec" directory, but the basic format is very simple.
Each message is a JSON document, signed by a RSA Public Key that is unique to each user.

We then pass these along to various servers, and organize them by Topics.

The main web-interface runs in "webfront.py"
The API runs in "api.py"

Pluric is written in Python3 and Tornado2.
