Readme will go here.
Better to write code than a doc for a product no one will read for now ;)



Using the following Libraries:
	yENC (under LGPL, see email below)
		For converting Binaries to Text.

	M2Crypto (MIT)
		For all Crypto work. Thanks!
	pylzma (LGPL)
		For reducing the size of on-disk saves.

Hi Colin,
I apologize for my bad English. Actually It's been a very long time
since I last worked on yenc module and I really don't have a
repository for the source, the only sources lying around I'm aware of
are those from the Debian repository.
Just let me know which version you're using and I will release it in
under LGPL (or consider yourself fully authorized to make all the
necessary modifications in disclaimers and comments, I know this is
not an orthodox approach)
