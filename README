Hi Colin,
I apologize for my bad English. Actually It's been a very long time
since I last worked on yenc module and I really don't have a
repository for the source, the only sources lying around I'm aware of
are those from the Debian repository.
Just let me know which version you're using and I will release it in
under LGPL (or consider yourself fully authorized to make all the
necessary modifications in disclaimers and comments, I know this is
not an orthodox approach)
